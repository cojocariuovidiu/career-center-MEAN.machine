Repo for team MEAN.machine

## Synopsis

There are approximately 1100 students and 8 career coaches at the WP Carey School of Business.  The ratio of coaches to students makes it very challenging to meet with and stay in touch with the large student population.  The existing web site lacks features and functionality that would allow students to monitor their progress towards their degrees.  Additionally, the web site does not allow real time, user friendly interface to keep in touch with students. 

It is for these reasons that the Career Center would like a user friendly web application that will target and reach a maximum population of students.  The initial product will be a responsive web application containing features and functionality outlined below.
